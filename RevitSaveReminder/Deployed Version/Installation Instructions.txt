RevitSaveReminder by Rod Howarth (http://www.rodhowarth.com)
Code available on GitHub - https://github.com/RodH257/RevitSaveReminder

Create C:\Program Files\RevitSaveReminder\ and put all files from zip there.

Move RevitSaveReminder-Manifest.addin to C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\Revit\Addins\2011\ if you are on Vista/7 

or 

to C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Autodesk\Revit\Addins\2011\ if you are on XP. 

It should then be installed! If you wish to configure the sound that is being played edit RevitSaveReminder.dll.config 
- I've included 'shotgun' 'chime' and 'applause' but you can put the full path to a ACM encoded wav file.
